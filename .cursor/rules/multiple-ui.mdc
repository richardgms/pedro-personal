PURPOSE
Create 3 different versions of the same UI so people can pick which one looks best.
STEPS FOR EACH VERSION


Read the style guide at designs/design.json and look at any example pictures for ideas
Make one HTML page that shows one complete screen based on the text description of what to build
Save each HTML file in the infinte_ui_cursor folder as ui_1.html, ui_2.html, ui_3.html (each file must have a different number)
